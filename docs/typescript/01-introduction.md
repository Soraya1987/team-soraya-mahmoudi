# Introduction to TypeScript

## What is TypeScript?
    TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript developed by Microsoft. It adds static typing, interfaces, and classes to JavaScript.

## Benefits
    - Catch errors early
    - Write cleaner, maintainable code
    - Full JavaScript compatibility
    - Great support in IDEs like VS Code

## Installation
    Global install:

```bash
    npm install -g typescript

Or for a project-specific installation:
    npm install --save-dev typescript

Compile and Run
  1.Create a TypeScript file:
    // hello.ts
       let message: string = "Hello, TypeScript!";
        console.log(message);

 2.Compile the .ts file to .js:
    tsc hello.ts

 3.Run the compiled JavaScript with Node:
    node hello.js

Conclusion
   TypeScript helps you write safer and cleaner JavaScript by adding static types, improving code maintainability and readability.
